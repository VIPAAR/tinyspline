TinySpline [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/VIPAAR/tinyspline.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/VIPAAR/tinyspline)
========

TinySpline is a C library for
[NURBS](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Uniform_Rational_B-Spline),
[B-Splines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline) and [BÃ©zier
curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve) (even lines and
points) with a modern C++11 wrapper and bindings for C#, Java and Python
(via Swig). The goal of this project is to provide a small library with a
minimum set of dependencies which is easy and intuitively to use. Moreover,
the integration of TinySpline into OpenGL is straightforward.

This is a branch of the official tinyspline from
(https://github.com/retuxx/tinyspline). This branch has stripped out
everything except the required functionality needed by Vipaar's
projects. It also includes a bug fix and support for CocoaPods.
